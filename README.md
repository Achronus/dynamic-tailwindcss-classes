# Dynamic Tailwind CSS Classes

This repository is dedicated to a niche problem I encountered when trying to create Dynamic Tailwind CSS classes in a React project. You can read more about it in my [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@achronus/solving-a-niche-frontend-problem-dynamic-tailwind-css-classes-in-react-da5f513ecf6a).

This project follows a simple setup of using Vite + React + Typescript with the Vite boilerplate code from the command:

```
npm create vite@latest <project_name> --template react-ts
```

And the addition of the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) package.


## Files to Explore

Here's some quick links to the updated boilerplate files for creating the final (`Enum`) solution:
- [App.jsx](/src/App.tsx)
- [enums.ts](/src/enums.ts)
- [tailwind.config.js](/tailwind.config.js)
