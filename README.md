# Dynamic Tailwind CSS Classes

This repository is dedicated to a niche problem I encountered when trying to create Dynamic Tailwind CSS classes in a React project. You can read more about it in my [Medium blog post]().

This project follows a simple setup of using Vite + React + Typescript with the Vite boilerplate code from the command:

```cmd
npm create vite@latest <project_name> --template react-ts
```

And the addition of the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) package.


## Files to Explore

Here's some quick links to the updated boilerplate files for creating the final (`Enum`) solution:
- [App.jsx](/main/src/App.tsx)
- [enums.ts](/main/src/enums.ts)
- [tailwind.config.js](/main/tailwind.config.js)
